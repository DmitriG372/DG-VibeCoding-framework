# Scale: Mini

> For prototypes, experiments, quick scripts

## When to Use

- Solo work, < 1 week
- Proof of concept
- Learning/experimenting
- Single-file or few-file projects

## PROJECT.md Additions

Add these sections to your PROJECT.md:

```markdown
---

## Quick Notes

[Freeform notes, ideas, decisions — no structure needed]

---

## Done

- [x] [What you completed]
```

## What to Skip

At mini scale, skip:
- Detailed architecture
- Sprint planning
- CI/CD setup
- Extensive testing

## Skills

Usually sufficient:
- `core` patterns from PROJECT.md
- `ui.skill` if frontend

## Workflow

```
Idea → PROJECT.md (basic) → Code → Ship
```

No branches, commit to main, deploy manually.
